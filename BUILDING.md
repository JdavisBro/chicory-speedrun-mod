# "Building"

You'll need:

- This repo cloned
- Chicory: A Colorful Tale
- UndertaleModTool CLI - Currently, gml importing is broken in regular CLI, [here's](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/473976215301128195/1098371650187182262/UMTCliPatched.zip) a patched one

Get your Mac Chicory of whatever version. Install commands are in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/JdavisBro/chicory-speedrun-mod/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

Put it in `Chicory/C.VER/`, so that the following would be correct (this example is version .55): `Chicory/C.55/game.ios`

Install [Macaroni](https://macaroni.chicory.pizza/) ALSO make sure to copy your `macaroni.win` back to the mac version. Example: `Chicory/C.55/macaroni.win`

Put UMT CLI in this directory such that UndertaleModTool/UndertaleModCli.exe is correct.

Run CreatePack.bat

Type the version number and press enter

Type `y` once prompted to create an install Pack or `n` and you can just copy InstallScripts/RunSpeedrunMod.bat to your chicory folder to run it.
