# "Building"

You'll need:

- This repo cloned
- Chicory: A Colorful Tale
- UndertaleModTool CLI - Currently, gml importing is broken in regular CLI, [here's](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/473976215301128195/1098371650187182262/UMTCliPatched.zip) a patched one or you can use the GUI version

Get your Windows Chicory of whatever version. Install commands are in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/JdavisBro/chicory-speedrun-mod/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

Put it in `Chicory/C.VER/`, so that the following would be correct (this example is version .55): `Chicory/C.55/game.win`

Install [Macaroni](https://macaroni.chicory.pizza/) so that this would be correct: `Chicory/C.55/macaroni.win` with the mac version of your version


Using CLI:

> Put UMT CLI in this directory such that UndertaleModTool/UndertaleModCli.exe is correct.

> Run ApplyMod.bat

> Type the version number and press enter

Using GUI:

> Run the GUI from the current dir using a command line

> Run script from file and choose ImportSpeedrunMod.csx

Run CreatePack.bat

Type the version number and press enter

This creates a pack for the version in Packs/C.VER/
