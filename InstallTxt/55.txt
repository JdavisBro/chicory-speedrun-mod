Installation:

Download the Windows version of Chicory for your version:

Open steam console by pressing ctrl + r and typing

steam://open/console

In steam console paste the following command:

download_depot 1123450 1123452 1811707737243329344

this will download version .55 of Chicory to BaseSteamFolder\steamapps\content\app_1123450\depot_1123451\

Rename and move the resources folder from that download, I'll call this the Game folder. This is usually at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_1123450\depot_1123451\PC\` for a regular steam installation.

Move the speedrun-mod folder into the game folder and go inside it.

Optional: Copy Controls and Settings from regular Chicory by running CopySettings.bat
Optional: Hiding Music Files

- To make the game folder easier to navigate you can run the HideAudioFiles.bat script found inside the speedrun-mod folder 
- If you want to make audio files visible again, you can turn on hidden files (File Explorer > View > Show > Hidden Files), select all (ctrl+a), right click > properties, and turn on hidden

Now run Patch.bat.

Installation complete! To run the mod go back to your game folder and run RunSpeedrunMod.bat

To update, move the new chicory-speedrun-mod folder into the game folder and run Patch.bat again.
